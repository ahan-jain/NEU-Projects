Some code i've worked on so far at Northeastern University as a Computer Science Major :D

The following programs were coded in DrRacket during my first semester as a student in the accelerated section of Fundamentals of Computer Science I (CS 2500), and I used the languages isl+ and asl.

**Shannon_Game:** This was our course project which we developed throughout the semester, where we created a game that allows a user to look at a digital circuit with some pre-existing input and output gates and prompts it to input some components of a grid (i.e. a conductive plate, a logical gate or an empty cell), which triggers a visual representation of the propogation of positive and/or negative charge in the circuit according to the components the user has inputted. The goal is to see of their version of the grid can match a set of 'goals', i.e. the given starting charges of the input gates should become the expected output charge by end of the propogation of charge. For the time being, all of these things are hard coded and nothing is user prompted unless the code is modified.

**Calculator:** A small "calculator," which has the same functionality as a calculator, but can support user input and "memory" operations (storing, recalling, and clearing). It does so using continuation-passing style (CPS), a style of programming in which control is passed explicitly in the form of a continuation.

**Chat Program:** A chat program that connects to a single server (a Northeastern Server) that is shared by all students in the class. The program is able to show a basic visual representation of a chat room, where one can send and recieve messages from other students, as well as block particular students and turn on and off rate limiting.
