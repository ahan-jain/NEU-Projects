This project implements a card game model based on Red7, where players compete using palettes of colored cards to meet certain game-winning conditions. 
The game includes both basic and advanced rules, with functionalities for shuffling, drawing, and playing cards.

How to Play:
The game revolves around players taking turns to play cards from their hand to meet specific winning conditions based on card color and value. 
Each player has a palette of cards, and the objective is to have the best card combination according to the current game rules.

In the solo version of the game, the player competes against a set of predefined rules and tries to win based on their card plays and the deck configuration.

Basic Rules:
Color Hierarchy: The game uses a color hierarchy where each color has a different priority. For example, Red > Orange > Blue > Indigo > Violet
Hand Management: Players are dealt cards, and they play to a palette or discard pile to change the game's current rules.
Winning Conditions: At the end of the game, the player who satisfies the most winning conditions based on their card colors and values wins.

Advanced Rules:
In the advanced version of the game:
Players may draw additional cards based on certain conditions.
The game incorporates a more complex set of winning conditions and drawing rules that increase strategy depth.
